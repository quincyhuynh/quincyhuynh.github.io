== About

I am a M.S. student in the [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/ Electrical Engineering and Computer Science] department at [http://www.berkeley.edu/ University of California, Berkeley]. My interests are in radio-frequency and analog circuit design. I currently do research under the guidance of Professor Steven Conolly in the BioE/EECS Department.

I also graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in EECS in Spring 2017. My main coursework was in integrated circuits and systems.

I'm an amateur ham radio - Callsign: W0SBQ
