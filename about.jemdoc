== About

I am a PhD candidate in the [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/ Electrical Engineering and Computer Science] department at [http://www.berkeley.edu/ University of California, Berkeley]. My interests are in radio-frequency and analog circuit design. I currently do research under the guidance of Professor Steven Conolly in the BioE/EECS Department.

My research is primarily in analog front end design for Magnetic Particle Imaging and Magnetic Particle Relaxometry. Some example projects include [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_BFAbiYAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_BFAbiYAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC optimized coil design] and [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_BFAbiYAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_BFAbiYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C ultra low noise preamplifier design].

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a M.S in EECS in Spring 2018 and a B.S. in EECS in Spring 2017. My main coursework was in integrated circuits and systems. I spent a large part of my undergraduate career as a teaching assistant, and I've continued to teach as a graduate student instructor. 

On the side I do consulting through [https://www.mosaicdesignlabs.com/ Mosaic Design Labs] (see consulting on the left).

I'm also an amateur ham radio! Callsign: W0SBQ
