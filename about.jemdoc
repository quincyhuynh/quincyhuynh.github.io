== About

I am an incoming PhD student in the [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/ Electrical Engineering and Computer Science] department at [http://www.berkeley.edu/ University of California, Berkeley]. My interests are in radio-frequency and analog circuit design. I currently do research under the guidance of Professor Steven Conolly in the BioE/EECS Department.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a M.S in EECS in Spring 2018 and a B.S. in EECS in Spring 2017. My main coursework was in integrated circuits and systems. I spent a large part of my undergraduate career as a teaching assistant, and I've continued to teach as a graduate student instructor.
