== About

I am an incoming PhD student to the [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/ Electrical Engineering and Computer Science] department at [http://www.berkeley.edu/ University of California, Berkeley] and currently finishing up my M.S. at the same school. My interests are in radio-frequency and analog circuit design with applications in medical devices and imaging. I currently do research under the guidance of [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sconolly.html Professor Steven Conolly] in the BioE/EECS Department.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in EECS in Spring 2017. My main coursework was in integrated circuits and systems. I spent a large part of my undergraduate career as a teaching assistant, and I've continued to teach as a graduate student instructor.
